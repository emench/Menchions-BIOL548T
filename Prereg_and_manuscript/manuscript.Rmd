# Abstract

1.  Ecologists often have lots of questions about lots of stuff

2.  We evaluated a bunch of things using sophisticated methods and carried out complicated statistical tests

3.  We discovered a bunch of things that we didn't already know but suspected

4.  Our research has greatly advanced out knowledge about stuff and will make a significant contribution to something and someone

**Key-words**: Ecology, Ericaceae, LDP, Plant Ecology, Vegetation Mapping, Vegetation Patterns

# Introduction

# Methods

To evaluate the ...

The above demonstrates both "inline" and "display" math formats. If you look at the Source version you will see that it is simply the number of \$ symbols before and after that differentiates between the two. An excellent (and simple) guide on inserting math into your R Markdown documents can be found here:\
<https://rpruim.github.io/s341/S19/from-class/MathinRmd.html>

Statistical analyses were carried out in R 3.4.0 (R Core Team 2017). All code along with the simulation algorithms used are available on Zenodo / GitHub <https://link_to_archived_release_or_GitHub.com>.

# Tables

**Table 1.** Mean body mass of penguins on different islands over time.

Note: for the word version the `kable` does not output correctly. You could try using `flextable` package instead: <https://taehoonh.me/content/post/alternative-to-kable-function-when-knitting-to-ms-word.html>

\`\`\`{#{r table_01, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}

# without the "hold_position" the table ends up at the top of the page

    \newpage

    # Figure Captions

    **Figure 1**. Pretty coloured dots about penguins

    **Figure 2**. Wow, even prettier plot about penguins that shows stuff

    \newpage

    # Figures

    ![]()

    Figure 1.

    \newpage

    ```{#{r figure_02, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Figure 2.

\newpage

Figure 3.

`{#{r file="../scripts/figure_03.R"} # this code chunk calls an external script to generate the plot. If you # want to load or run code not for a plot you could also use the following. # Note that it does not seem to work for plots. # source("../scripts/figure_03.R", local = knitr::knit_global())`

\newpage

# Appendices

```{=html}
<!-- You might want to look into Bookdown if you want to do anything fancier
with your manuscript. Bookdown allows for automatic Table and Figure numbering
as well as cross referencing. That is you can create links between 'Fig 1' in
your manuscript that links to the actual figure and automatically the
the figure number as you add or remove them from the document.
I add this here because Appendices can require special handling by some 
journals and Bookdown might allow you to do that automagically -->
