We provide a zip file containing three cvs files. The two main files (Matrice_X.cvs and Matrice_Y.cvs) contains the independent and dependent data used in
the RDA analyses presented in the article. The Climate_value.cvs file is needed to interpret the GDD PRECU PRECT VPD ARI MAT DWFC EVA variables in the X matrix.


- File Matrice_X.cvs contains the explanatory variables (see variable description below)
- File Matrice_Y.cvs contains the response variables (mean ericaceous cover, in %)
- File Climate_value.cvs contains the numerical codes used for the climatic variables in the Matrice_X.cvs file.
